title: Giving, Altruism 
---

I first heard of Effective Altruism and Giving What We Can at a birthday party, a couple of years back.
Ever since, I've been thinking and talking about this rather frequently with a few people.

One of them recently told me that she started donating more, after (and at least partially thanks to) our talks.
Hearing this was rather embarassing, since I myself focused on increasing the size of my buffer instead of donating more.

## Reluctance to give more

I believe there were a few reasons that ennabled me to dwell in my reluctance:

- reason1
- reason2
- reason3

## Next steps

I decided to change this, and here's a measure public accountability:

- reason4
- reason5
- reason6

## Transparency

[I keep coming back to this...]
