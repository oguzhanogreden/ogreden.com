We don't default to openness and transparency.
At the individual level, public conversations on e.g. financial matters and mental health remain <outside the norm>.
At an institutional level, [best efforts](link to post about fairtrade and cash flow transparency) may not be delivering what they set out to.
Yet, these efforts are outstanding considering that they are in the company of only a handful of extraordinary examples.

There [is](url) [an](url) [increasing](url) [demand](url) for transparency, as well as [ethical]() [behavior]().
I think it's time for me to address this at an individual level.
(Why does this need to be public at an individual level is a valid question.
The short answer is that this motivates me.
The long answer will be cear soon.)

## Transparency at an individual level

I blushed the first time I've seen Giving What We Can's [How Rich Am I?](https://howrichami.givingwhatwecan.org/how-rich-am-i).
That was a period in which I experienced my life as too unstable to be comfortable, and I let the blushing thoughts slip away.
About a year ago, I found more room to think about this and set up regular donations.

Recently, a friend of mine and I decided to engage in ongoing discussions about our donation behavior.
We had two goals:

1. We would potentially make better decisions, since we both regarded our opinion highly yet had different perspectives,
2. We could potentially make more donations, since we both would encourage each other to donate to causes that 

Then I blushed again, and a few times more.
Each time I blushed, I took it as a warning to correct my course and it worked wonders.

At the moment, I'm donating 1.1% of my dispensible income.
This is still too little, but is also the highest amount for me.
The perspective that it's too little is primarily a social judgement.
That judgement is enabled by the likes of [Toby Ord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toby_Ord), [Dario Amodei](https://blog.givewell.org/2010/06/03/my-donation-for-2009-guest-post-from-dario-amodei/).
I don't intend to be another Toby Ord, but perhaps something slightly different.

## Transparency in ethical retail

One of the premises of ethical retail is that the buyer expresses a willingness to pay a premium.
The premium is paid for different purposes: increased human welfare, increased animal welfare or decreased environmental footprint are the most common instances.
In any of these instances, what is considered "good" is largely arbitrary.
It is better for an individual to receive the minimum wage and all associated labor rights they are entitled to due to their labor in a textile workshop, if the alternative is being paid less than the minimum wage and not having social security.
On the other hand, it is clearly not good _enough_ for a Turkish worker to be paid a salary that does not provide decent living conditions, since that is the reality of life with minimum wage in most industrial Turkish cities.

This is not an example I made up.
[Most of the fair-trade jeans produced in Turkey are in this condition](another post).

Today, the brands and the people who promise to deliver ethical goods rely on a framework which establishes "good" and "bad".
At the core of this framework is certification organisations, which split shelves into "good products" and "regular/bad products"
One recent example is Oatly.
Oatly is trying to push the industry to "show their numbers" so that consumers can be informed about the environmental impact of the products they are consuming.
It is time for a similar push in the ethical retail market.

### Introducing mndr shop

This is the main premise behind [mndr](https://buymndr.com) [shop](https://mndr.shop).
`mndr` can be read as `minder` in Dutch, meaning "less/fewer".
[mndr shop](#) stands for fewer walls between the buyer, the seller and the producer.
My goal is to challenge the established assumptions about transparency in ethical retail.

The main piller of this goal is price transparency.
When you buy from [mndr shop](#), you will know exactly where each cent is going.
Using this information, you can make better choices that maximize the revenue of producers.

The second pillar of this goal is commercial transparency.
When a producer works with me, they will be able to see the financial model of [mndr shop].
This will reduce [information asymmetry](#) and strengthen their bargaining position.
If I succeed, this change will be structural: any producer who's in a related industry will be able to demand a bigger share of the profit margin from their buyers, or otherwise work with me.

Final pillar oof this goal is ethical transparency.
In the ever-connected world we are living, ethical decisions are difficult.
I will be completely transparent with ethical difficulties I am facing, and seek support of my community.
Eventually, we might not have the perfect answer but we will be better off than not having conversed.

## My experience

### [Giving]({% link pages/giving.md %})


Last year, I had the room to think about it again and committed to some meager monthly donations.
Then transparency happened, and I blushed again.

The second blush arrived at a dinner with a friend, when we went through [relationship anarchy smorgasbord](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=relationship+anarchy+smorgasbord&ia=web).
When we arrived at the "financial" plate, I suggested that I'd like to talk more about money.
Talking about how much do we give, and where, would be useful for two reasons:

And, it worked!
Since the start of these chats I have made additional donations that add up to my monthly donation average of the past 12 months (as of Aug 2020).
And recently, as we were discussing a discrepancy in our donation behavior, I felt a healthy pressure to increase my regular donations and doubled them.

What's next?
Well, at the moment, I'm donating less than 2% of my disposable income, and I think that is too low.
By the end of this year, I'd like to have increased that by 10%.
