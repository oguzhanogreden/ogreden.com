        <title>How could I have done this for times faster?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s the end of my first week with &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/02/20/pivot-career-software/&quot;&gt;my new team&lt;/a&gt;. Towards the end of the week, I came across a Tweet:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Why couldn’t we deliver this 4 times faster is a good question for software development teams to be asking.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t find the Tweet, but If I recall correctly, the author meant to suggest this as a question that would help developers stretch their imagination and focus on their tooling. I took it a bit differently: It’s not a stretch for me to imagine that I will soon produce four times what I’ve produced this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at my week with this lens, what were the time sinkholes for me? Two things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’ve tested my solutions too many times.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I hadn’t read the documentation of my dependencies well enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve tested too many times primarily because conjuring a mental “infinite zoom overview” of my work has been difficult. Both on the backend with microservices and in the frontend with Angular, this slowed me down prohibitively. This was compounded by the fact that I’m far from having a solid knowledge of the many specifics of external dependencies, frameworks and in-house solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading documentation in a rushed way is a classic, of course. This was a case of “I just want this damn thing to be done” and I should’ve &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/04/11/very-recently/&quot;&gt;known better&lt;/a&gt;&lt;!--[[202104112132 (very) recently - post]]--&gt;. There isn’t much to do but to remind yourself that this does not save time, after all. Reading documentation may also be the only way to get confident with specifics of everything.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Presence, Absence, Computing</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(I thought this would become something better, it didn’t work out, but I have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.beeminder.com/oguzhanogreden/w-daily&quot;&gt;a promise&lt;/a&gt;!)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A non-controversial statement: Computing is about references.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’d like to refer to something that exists and do something with it. Now you can’t stop there: You need to be able to refer to non-existence, null. Maybe you are someone who can think of 0 as something other than a reference to non-existence. If you need to represent something electrically (utimately), you will need first and foremost have to distinguish presence and absence of electricity. If you find yourself in the sad profession of representing things electrically, you will realise that you need to give up. Forget about all those “other things 0 can be.” You will call “that doesn’t exist” 0 and “that exists” 1, and move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have 1, and 0 so that you can have 1, you have infinitely many references that you can use. That you are using.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>No-CV</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For years, one of the most prominent elements on this page has been a link to my CV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon, the same will be there but will read “no-CV” and will link to this page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This comes from the realization that when I think of my CV, I think of a different thing than most. I would like to take &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; to my work. As this is my “CV”, it makes more sense for me to link you to it: &lt;a href=&quot;https://ozan.ogreden.com&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, which isn’t in a good state, but that’s not how it will stay!bb&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Spaced Repetition, Flinches / Ugh-Fields</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;About 15 months ago. I have started (re-)using Anki for expanding my Dutch vocabulary. After a few months of dutiful daily Anki practices, it had become a dull exercise. My search for Anki-revival tactics led me to Michael Nielsen’s essay &lt;a href=&quot;http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html&quot;&gt;Augmenting Long-term Memory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using Anki for topics other than language has been an interesting experience. For instance, engaging with a topic/material at regular but not always predictable intervals has been emotionally pleasing for me. This venue is actively researched by Andy Matuschak and you should check &lt;a href=&quot;https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=zUw5PuD8op9oq8kHvni6sug6eRTNtR9Wqma&amp;amp;stackedNotes=z4rRX3qwSSJRsEkdXKwH2shamgHNeRthrMLiF&quot;&gt;his work&lt;/a&gt; out if you’re into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just today I’ve run into a radically interesting use case at the intersection of spaced repetition and mental health. Internet is a small world, so this happens to be located on a blog that I distinctly remember visiting earlier: &lt;a href=&quot;http://becomingeden.com/developing-object-permanence-around-flinches/&quot;&gt;becomingeden.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/04/11/very-recently/&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;&lt;!--[[202104112132 (very) recently - post]]--&gt;, today has been generous with inspiring stuff, too.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>EBS for individuals</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve read Joel Spolsky’s Evidence Based Scheduling a while ago, thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.beeminder.com/t/20th-anniversary-of-the-joel-test-for-software-teams/7096/25&quot;&gt;a discussion&lt;/a&gt; in Beeminder forums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s written from the developer team management perspective. In it’s essence, Evidence Based Scheduling calibrates developers’ estimation performance so that realistic estimates can be obtained. (A key aspect of the method is that it also quantifies the confidence one may have in an estimate, but that’s besides the point.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think EBS may also be useful from the individual perspective. In the practice suggested by Joel, “velocities” that are older than 6 months discarded since estimators get better at estimating. Someone who’s early in their career could also get noticably better and faster in such a time span. A side effect of EBS data would then be making explicit if “5 story points” came to mean 8 days to 4 days, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>(Very) recently</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tmcw&quot;&gt;Tom MacWright’s&lt;/a&gt; Recently series, and to appease &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.beeminder.com/oguzhanogreden/w-posted&quot;&gt;Beeminder&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;notes-for-junior-developers&quot;&gt;Notes for junior developers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be starting working as a developer next week. As in any problem solving domain, problems I will get will have a few good and many bad solutions. My focus in this “first period” will be focusing on learning what makes a solution good, and when to make a trade-off for a worse solution for the sake of e.g. speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developing problem solving expertise is difficult. Surely, I will feel lost, tried and tried, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brainpickings.org/2012/10/15/when-charles-darwin-hated-everybody/&quot;&gt;hate everybody &amp;amp; everything&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s some advice from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dulcedejae/status/1366698180340047874&quot;&gt;jae anne&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1366728171534565376&quot;&gt;Dan Abramov&lt;/a&gt; on how to tackle this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, jae anne shouts a warning that anytime something works but you don’t understand it, you should treat it as it’s “not working” and your work not done. You just don’t give into the feeling of “I just want this damn thing to be done.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a sense, these are obvious. In another sense, it’s hard for me to tell “Up to which resolution should &lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt; understand what’s going on here?” before being able to use jae anne’s suggestion. That’s easier to do for me than following their advice, and is a pre-requisite too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;command-line-tools-that-compete-with-a-hadoop-cluster&quot;&gt;Command-line tools that compete with a Hadoop Cluster&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adam Drake wrote (many years ago) &lt;a href=&quot;https://adamdrake.com/command-line-tools-can-be-235x-faster-than-your-hadoop-cluster.html&quot;&gt;a short demo&lt;/a&gt; of what can be achieved with &lt;a href=&quot;https://brandur.org/small-sharp-tools&quot;&gt;small, sharp tools&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m pretty happy if I can pipe &lt;a href=&quot;https://parkbee.github.io/data-til/2020/11/05/find-and-replace-extension-regex/&quot;&gt;two shell commands&lt;/a&gt; (and not lose any file), while Adam goes on to parallelize operations and all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspiring stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;shorthand-for-shaping&quot;&gt;“Shorthand for shaping”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve always found shorthand a bit magical. In my own way, I have about 7 shortcuts defined for &lt;a href=&quot;https://espanso.org&quot;&gt;espanso&lt;/a&gt;. That’s all I have to say about shorthand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also custom (sometimes ad-hoc) shorthands that people use. Ryan Singer’s essay &lt;a href=&quot;https://world.hey.com/rjs/9-shorthand-for-shaping-cc672da1&quot;&gt;“Shorthand for shaping”&lt;/a&gt; is a short exposition of a custom shorthand of how he used a simple shorthand notation for thinking about a early stage design process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being someone who doesn’t know shorthand, neither designs anything, I found it pretty interesting to see that a sketch like this is part of the process:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Looking for: Meta blub studies</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Blub studies is not a very good &lt;a href=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/02/20/writing-advice/&quot;&gt;concept-handle&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not very clear what “blub” is. It is, however, a great meme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its shortest definition, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.benkuhn.net/blub/&quot;&gt;blub studies&lt;/a&gt; is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;the study of what goes on in the guts of these boring, everyday systems–not the kind you get tenure for inventing, but the kind people actually use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben Kuhn suggests “kickstarting ‘your blub flywheel’” however you can. He promises it will eventually pay off greatly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have an appetite for blub studies. And this sounds like a good advice to me.  I will heed it. Just like I followed the “Use Vim emulation in an IDE” advice, as a person with an appetite for keyboard-dominant interaction with my computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like there’s something missing. There must be a “blub-studies studies” level that we can rise to. At that level, we could ask and answer questions like: How to build appetite for blub-studies? How to get better at it? I don’t think I have come across this yet. Except perhaps in The Zen and Motorcycle Maintenance, or Philosophical Explanations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(This came my way thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jvns.ca&quot;&gt;Julia Evans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;!--[[202104041301 Julia Evans]]--&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Ghulheim, a drawing by Neil Gaiman</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Even from the path below Ghûlheim, even from miles away, Bod could see that all of the angles were wrong–that the walls sloped crazily, that it was every nightmare he had ever endured made into a place, like a huge mouth of jutting teeth. It was a city that had been built just to be abandoned, in which all the fears and madnesses and revulsions of the creatures who built it were made into stone. The ghoul-folk had found it and delighted in it and called it home. &lt;em&gt;(The Graveyard Book, Neil Gaiman)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a great description. I could attempt at a good sketch how Ghûlheim looks, and likely fail to caricaturize how Evil it looks. The wickedness of the city Neil Gaiman describes  is as pointy as it needs to be: it’s a good specimen of the familiar &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=dark+scary+town+illustration&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwj7mPHetufvAhXN2rsIHddlAZoQ2-cCegQIABAA&quot;&gt;Dark Scary Town Illustration&lt;/a&gt; with a touch of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=dark%20scary%20town%20illustration%20tim%20burton&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;tbs=rimg:CZ1leCtb2WFyYRNZA6gyR6Tg&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0CAIQrnZqFwoTCJj79tS35-8CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAC&amp;amp;biw=1265&amp;amp;bih=1313&quot;&gt;Tim Burton aesthetics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
