        <title>Worth Noticing</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I use Beeminder to track a few goals. Some of these are quite essential for my wellbeing, some aren’t (like my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.beeminder.com/oguzhanogreden/w-daily&quot;&gt;commitment to write these daily notes&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took me a really long while to realise one area where Beeminder really shines: It functions perfectly as a trigger for you to notice things. That goal you said you’d stick to? Well, you haven’t. And it won’t just fade into background, it will take 5 bucks from your wallet.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Shell Culture</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After years of “having to” and “fighting with”, I’m finally grokking shell scripting, I think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While trying to get &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/oguzhanogreden/dotfiles/blob/master/scripts/bmndr-tmin.sh&quot;&gt;a shell script&lt;/a&gt; to work on OhMyZsh. I vaguely though of a  scene from Where Wizards Stay Up Late. The main difference between the experience of the developers described there and my experience was that I never had to think of a “LOGIN” to be truncated to “LO” due to network issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never had to think of my programs as a stream of characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when I read the comment “Sorry, I should have thought about echoing the contents of course.” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/275797&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), it just made sense.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Two Histories, and Another One</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.notion.so/Broad-Band-by-Claire-L-Evans-a1ec6dffff4940d6852e071210f0910e&quot;&gt;Broad Band&lt;/a&gt; by Claire L. Evans right after Where the Wizards Stay Up Late has been interesting so far. There’s a lot to of good things to be said about Broad Band, and I may do that once I’m through the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most striking differences is how they chose their frames. Reading Where Wizards Stay Up Late, you get to know two groups of people: the mighty wizards and the powerful man. It’s as much the story of the powerful man who paved a way as it is about mighty wizards who marched the paved path in their own inspiring, awkward and adorable manner. You get to imagine an ARPA director providing millions of dollars of funding. You get to forget the literal army of people that made this possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading Broad Band, you get the taste of a different story. It’s a balancing act. There are pointers to existing histories of the wizards, but you’re reading a &lt;em&gt;wider&lt;/em&gt; history. One in which women who had to persevere through sexism in some of its most hideous forms is at the center of the stage. You read stories of women who had to embrace a horrible kind of grind. Next to the very familiar kind of grind &lt;a href=&quot;https://jacobian.org/2021/apr/7/embrace-the-grind/&quot;&gt;that makes things possible&lt;/a&gt;&lt;!--[202104122020 Embrace the Grind] --&gt;, that makes them happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s then disappointing a bit when you see other faces through lines that you were just allowed to forget. When efforts that helped commit one of the most horrorful atrocities of our history gets credited as “saving time and lives.”&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How could I have done this for times faster?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s the end of my first week with &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/02/20/pivot-career-software/&quot;&gt;my new team&lt;/a&gt;. Towards the end of the week, I came across a Tweet:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Why couldn’t we deliver this 4 times faster is a good question for software development teams to be asking.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t find the Tweet, but If I recall correctly, the author meant to suggest this as a question that would help developers stretch their imagination and focus on their tooling. I took it a bit differently: It’s not a stretch for me to imagine that I will soon produce four times what I’ve produced this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at my week with this lens, what were the time sinkholes for me? Two things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’ve tested my solutions too many times.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I hadn’t read the documentation of my dependencies well enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve tested too many times primarily because conjuring a mental “infinite zoom overview” of my work has been difficult. Both on the backend with microservices and in the frontend with Angular, this slowed me down prohibitively. This was compounded by the fact that I’m far from having a solid knowledge of the many specifics of external dependencies, frameworks and in-house solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading documentation in a rushed way is a classic, of course. This was a case of “I just want this damn thing to be done” and I should’ve &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/04/11/very-recently/&quot;&gt;known better&lt;/a&gt;&lt;!--[[202104112132 (very) recently - post]]--&gt;. There isn’t much to do but to remind yourself that this does not save time, after all. Reading documentation may also be the only way to get confident with specifics of everything.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Presence, Absence, Computing</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(I thought this would become something better, it didn’t work out, but I have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.beeminder.com/oguzhanogreden/w-daily&quot;&gt;a promise&lt;/a&gt;!)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A non-controversial statement: Computing is about references.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’d like to refer to something that exists and do something with it. Now you can’t stop there: You need to be able to refer to non-existence, null. Maybe you are someone who can think of 0 as something other than a reference to non-existence. If you need to represent something electrically (utimately), you will need first and foremost have to distinguish presence and absence of electricity. If you find yourself in the sad profession of representing things electrically, you will realise that you need to give up. Forget about all those “other things 0 can be.” You will call “that doesn’t exist” 0 and “that exists” 1, and move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have 1, and 0 so that you can have 1, you have infinitely many references that you can use. That you are using.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>No-CV</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For years, one of the most prominent elements on this page has been a link to my CV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon, the same will be there but will read “no-CV” and will link to this page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This comes from the realization that when I think of my CV, I think of a different thing than most. I would like to take &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; to my work. As this is my “CV”, it makes more sense for me to link you to it: &lt;a href=&quot;https://ozan.ogreden.com&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, which isn’t in a good state, but that’s not how it will stay!bb&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Spaced Repetition, Flinches / Ugh-Fields</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;About 15 months ago. I have started (re-)using Anki for expanding my Dutch vocabulary. After a few months of dutiful daily Anki practices, it had become a dull exercise. My search for Anki-revival tactics led me to Michael Nielsen’s essay &lt;a href=&quot;http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html&quot;&gt;Augmenting Long-term Memory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using Anki for topics other than language has been an interesting experience. For instance, engaging with a topic/material at regular but not always predictable intervals has been emotionally pleasing for me. This venue is actively researched by Andy Matuschak and you should check &lt;a href=&quot;https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=zUw5PuD8op9oq8kHvni6sug6eRTNtR9Wqma&amp;amp;stackedNotes=z4rRX3qwSSJRsEkdXKwH2shamgHNeRthrMLiF&quot;&gt;his work&lt;/a&gt; out if you’re into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just today I’ve run into a radically interesting use case at the intersection of spaced repetition and mental health. Internet is a small world, so this happens to be located on a blog that I distinctly remember visiting earlier: &lt;a href=&quot;http://becomingeden.com/developing-object-permanence-around-flinches/&quot;&gt;becomingeden.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/04/11/very-recently/&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;&lt;!--[[202104112132 (very) recently - post]]--&gt;, today has been generous with inspiring stuff, too.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>EBS for individuals</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve read Joel Spolsky’s Evidence Based Scheduling a while ago, thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.beeminder.com/t/20th-anniversary-of-the-joel-test-for-software-teams/7096/25&quot;&gt;a discussion&lt;/a&gt; in Beeminder forums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s written from the developer team management perspective. In it’s essence, Evidence Based Scheduling calibrates developers’ estimation performance so that realistic estimates can be obtained. (A key aspect of the method is that it also quantifies the confidence one may have in an estimate, but that’s besides the point.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think EBS may also be useful from the individual perspective. In the practice suggested by Joel, “velocities” that are older than 6 months discarded since estimators get better at estimating. Someone who’s early in their career could also get noticably better and faster in such a time span. A side effect of EBS data would then be making explicit if “5 story points” came to mean 8 days to 4 days, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;
