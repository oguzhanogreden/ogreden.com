It all started when I woke up with a thirst for tinkering, and reached for an old laptop that's been lying in my bookshelf for far too long. That laptop is now running Debian 10 and is serving this webpage.

The set up went rather smoothly. There was but one glitch.

It turns out, there's a thing called "hairpinning" or "a NAT loopback" which is a small piece of technology that allows you to act as if you're outside a network while you're within. The Ziggo Connectbox that is installed at my apartment does not have a NAT loopback. This meant after I set up the server, and did the portforwarding set up, I would still see get a connection timeout error. It took me 30 minutes until I've come across [some](https://ziggoforum.nl/topics/problemen-met-portforwarding-en-lokale-toegang.92853/#post-1263778) [forum posts](https://ziggoforum.nl/topics/port-forwarding-op-de-connectbox-lukt-niet.91320/#post-1219298). 

I already feel my fingers getting itchy to search for a better Jekyll theme, but the point is to learn about server management, not becoming a blogger, so... I will postpone switching to a plain-text-ish theme to later.
