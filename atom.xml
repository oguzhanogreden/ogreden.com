   <title>Ways I'm available to help</title>
   <link href="https://ozan.ogreden.com/2021/05/15/help/"/>

   <id>https://ozan.ogreden.com/2021/05/15/help</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summary: Do you think I can help you? Let me know. Email me at oguzhanogreden@protonmail.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve come across many helpful people on the internet.
Some of them did help me actively, some of them had simply written something that turned out to be useful for me.
The actual individuals who helped me in past have been long offline.
Their presence has lost the flavor that attracted me to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can hint the flavor by giving contemporary examples, though.
I’m thinking of people like &lt;a href=&quot;https://jacobian.org/help/&quot;&gt;Jacob Kaplan-Moss&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://lethain.com/ways-i-help/&quot;&gt;Will Larson&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.evjang.com/2020/06/free-office-hours-for-non-traditional.html&quot;&gt;Eric Jang&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have nothing of the sort of experience these people have, but do get a few emails per year asking me about one of the “non-traditional” experiences I had.
Most of these emails have a rather reserved tone, if not outright apologetic for demanding my time.
I suppose there may be a few more emails that never got sent.
I hope this note lowers the threshold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the topics I’ve received questions on include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Getting an applied statistics master’s degree after studying psychology&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Getting a data science job with a social science background&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Living in the Netherlands as a Turkish immigrant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The questions I may be (and I’d like to) offer help with are not limited to these, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Angular nested forms with ControlValueAccessor interface</title>
   <link href="https://ozan.ogreden.com/2021/05/15/angular-nested-form/"/>
   <updated>2021-05-15T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
   <id>https://ozan.ogreden.com/2021/05/15/angular-nested-form</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This post has but one message for Angular users: Your nested form implementation may be better off with a ControlValueAccessor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not the first one &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/a/55674946&quot;&gt;to do this&lt;/a&gt;.
Nevertheless a disclaimer and a request: I’ve had about four weeks of professional Angular development experience, &lt;a href=&quot;https://brandur.org/fragments/engineering-skepticism&quot;&gt;apply healthy skepticism&lt;/a&gt; with abundance.
I’m writing to clarify my understanding, and give something to the community.
If you think the claim is preposterous, reach out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s get you convinced by building up a minimally realistic example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose we have a form that used to input how many customers we can accept in a given day. Initially, the form is very simple. There is one integer input field per day. The only validation requirement is that the capacity can’t be smaller than 0 or larger than 20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We implement this with one component that has a FormGroup property and bind the controls manually. This is the simplest use of Angular Reactive Forms. You can find a barebones example &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackblitz.com/github/oguzhanogreden/example-nested-form-cva/tree/0fb88df86ee9cedd231a7fde629d18ae9f51fcec&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let’s imagine a more complex second iteration for the form. We need to be able to support varying capacity throughout the day. That is, instead of a single integer input, we need to allow the user to add/remove time periods, which are specified by a start time, an end time and a capacity. We need to make sure that user can’t enter an end time that’s earlier than the start time. And we need to make sure that the total capacity doesn’t exceed 20 within a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conceptually, we have two conceptual levels: the time period level and the day level. We can implement two components, and nest the time period component in the day component. We can then reuse the time period component within and across days, and the day component across days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s my solution, where each component implements ControlValueAccessor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe style=&quot;width: 100%; height: 400px;&quot; src=&quot;https://stackblitz.com/github/oguzhanogreden/example-nested-form-cva/tree/main?ctl=1&amp;amp;embed=1&amp;amp;file=src/app/form/form.component.ts&amp;amp;hideNavigation=1&amp;amp;view=editor&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think there are three key implementation details worth noting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Components that implement &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ControlValueAccessor&lt;/code&gt; interface bind to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;FormControl&lt;/code&gt;s, and not to a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;FormGroup&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;FormArray&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You need to notify parents of value changes, just like the default value accessors for e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/11.2.13/packages/forms/src/directives/default_value_accessor.ts#L144-L148&quot;&gt;number inputs&lt;/a&gt; do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ControlValueAccessor interface is very helpful here, especially while handling nested arrays that do not have a predetermined size. The interface is called a &lt;strong&gt;Control&lt;/strong&gt;ValueAccessor for a reason ;) Don’t forget the point 1 above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one final implementation detail:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You need to trigger change detection if a parent acts in a way that a child causes a change in the validity of the parent without triggering change detection automatically. This is the case e.g. when the parent triggers initialisation of a child which initializes in invalid state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my limited experience, this implementation is the most flexible and the most idiomatic one. Do you disagree? I’d be happy to learn from you!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Advice reversal, again</title>
   <link href="https://ozan.ogreden.com/notebook/2021/04/30"/>
   <updated>2021-04-30T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
   <id>https://ozan.ogreden.com/notebook/2021/04/advice-reversal-again</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I asked a friend of mine to review my post &lt;a href=&quot;/notebook/2021/04/26&quot;&gt;“On ‘The Art of Doing Science and Engineering’”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;!--[[202104262127 On The Art of Doing Science and Engineering]]--&gt; for me. One of the questions she had for me was “So do we want to understand the maths or not?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one sense, the point I tried to make with the earlier post was the familiar “advice reversal advice” in disguise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone could advise used Hamming’s example on “Why it matters to be able to predict the future?” in two directions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is well known the drunken sailor who staggers to the left or right with \(n\) independent random steps will, on the average, end up about \(\sqrt n\) steps from the origin. But if there is a pretty girl in one direction, then his steps will tend to go in that direction and he will go a distance proportional to \(n\). In a lifetime of many, many independent choices, small and large, a career with a vision will get you a distance proportional to \(n\), while no vision will get you only the distance \(\sqrt n\).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One would be “Oh you don’t need to understand maths to get the message.” Another would be “It’s essential that you understand how Hamming makes that conclusion and you should not do anything prior to that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, reverse that advice.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>What does that button do?</title>
   <link href="https://ozan.ogreden.com/notebook/2021/04/29"/>
   <updated>2021-04-29T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
   <id>https://ozan.ogreden.com/notebook/2021/04/buttons</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;At work, I get to click a button, wait 5 minutes and see my work deployed in either test, UAT or production environment. With almost no stress that something infrastructural can go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our DevOps team is telling us that we will have to think less about this process in near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am growing curious: What does that button do, exactly?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, there are two buttons. One is “pressed” by a webhook from Github (I think?) and builds and stores a Docker image. The other then actually does the deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The container is built through this steps, noted down verbosely:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Initialize job&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pre-job
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Download pgp dev&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Download pgp data&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Download sops file&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;helm package&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Checkout git repository&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ensure PGP key installed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Construct version number&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fetch tags&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set the Helm Chart version on on values-*.json&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Update dependencies
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;test [environment]&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;uat [environment]&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;upload: Helm folder&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clean Docker cache&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Docker login&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Generate Helm charts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Download: helm charts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remove unnecessary files&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Override deployment&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Helm lint&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Helm package&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Build an image&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Push the image&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Push to chart museum&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Push to chart museum prod&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Publish artifact: environments&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Update patch numberin variable group&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clean agent directories&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Post-job:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;clean agent directories&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;helm package&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Checkout gitrepository (??)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the deployment is done through these steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Initialize job&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pre-job
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Download pgp dev&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Download pgp data&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Download artifact - build - environments&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Download artifact - build - full-helm-chart&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ensure PGP key installed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Deploy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Finalize job&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

   <title>On "The Art of Doing Science and Engineering"</title>
   <link href="https://ozan.ogreden.com/notebook/2021/04/26"/>
   <updated>2021-04-26T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
   <id>https://ozan.ogreden.com/notebook/2021/04/art-of-hamming</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Books written for a different audience are hard to read. I don’t belong to the wide audience of Hamming’s “The Art of Doing Science and Engineering.” I admit parts of the book cost me way too much time. So you can imagine the comfort I felt when I read that I could skip the maths:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Later sections will be understandable […]. General results are always stated in words […]”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I kept on reading. The book is about “style”, after all. I am interested in his general results. It did, however, hurt a bit to read:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Later sections will be understandable provided you are willing to forgo the deep insights mathematics gives into the weaknesses of our current beliefs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first chapter of the book is titled “Orientation.” which gives a good taste of Hamming’s style: a delightful mix of a mathematically clear mind, self-help a la The Art of Manliness, and eloquently delivered life advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick glance and I see that many are attracted to one of the latter, rather than for the mathematically clear mind. For I came across quotes from the self-help (for researchers?) bits, &lt;a href=&quot;https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2021/03/22/richard-hammings-the-art-of-doing-science-and-engineering/&quot;&gt;Andrew Gelman expressing unfulfilled career desires&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3746698/the-art-of-doing-science-and-engineering-back-of-the-envelope-math&quot;&gt;one person who asked a question on StackExchange&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll consider the following self-evident: you should not read quotes from a book on “style”. Gelman’s discovery is both useful to him, and gives you a hint on how you can become Gelman’s student, if you’re into that sort of thing. I’ll focus on the question on StackExchange. (A message to the writer of the question: I hope this helps you enjoy it more the next time. My purpose is not to discourage you from picking up the book again, or cause any other emotional distress.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the examples of this chapter is an illustration of how to quickly evaluate two well-specified hypothesis. This is an important example, because, again, “Style of thinking is the center of the course.” and it is the style that allows the evaluation. It is the style that is on display.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The style is elaborate enough for 227 pages from Hamming, I won’t even try to summarise it. Here’s an example, though:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I will take […] two statements, knowledge doubles every 17 years, and 90% of the scientists who ever lived are now alive, and ask to what extent they are compatible. The model of the growth of knowledge and the growth of scientists assumed are both exponential, with the growth of knowledge being proportional to the number of scientists alive. We begin by assuming the number scientists at any time t is
\(y(t) = ae^{bt}\)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may feel like you’re missing something obvious, like the original poster: “What’s a? What’s T? I assume e is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant)&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; guy.” Then you need to listen to Hamming. I recommend you make sure you can parse the paragraph into the formula with the help of a pen and a paper. (And yes, the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;e&lt;/code&gt; is that guy, as it will very, very frequently be. Consider making it a habit to try to full in that guy each time you see &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;e&lt;/code&gt; in math before asking it. You may end up thinking faster.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may seem like too much effort, but consider trying how long it takes you to evaluate those statements with full confidence in your result. And think whether you could express your method with extreme precision to many thousands of people in half a page like Manning does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the journey!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t forget - “Do not think the technical content is the course—it is only illustrative material.” But you better understand the illustrations really well, if you’re to learn “style” from a book.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The sense of a bean sprout</title>
   <link href="https://ozan.ogreden.com/notebook/2021/04/23"/>

   <id>https://ozan.ogreden.com/notebook/2021/04/sense-of-a-bean-sprout</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“[…] if you have the sense of a bean sprout you know you’re in a rare and irreproducible presence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analogy is obvious, it’s just been lying there for someone to reach at it. Only one person &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=%22sense+of+a+bean+sprout%22&amp;amp;client=firefox-b-d&amp;amp;ei=fCODYJPRLP2H9u8Pvs-PuA0&amp;amp;oq=%22sense+of+a+bean+sprout%22&amp;amp;gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAMyCAghEBYQHRAeOgcIABBHELADUPAUWJ0fYIYhaAFwAngAgAFPiAHfAZIBATOYAQCgAQGqAQdnd3Mtd2l6yAEIwAEB&amp;amp;sclient=gws-wiz&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwiT__ehkJXwAhX9g_0HHb7nA9cQ4dUDCA0&amp;amp;uact=5&quot;&gt;seems to have done it&lt;/a&gt;, Ursula K. LeGuin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She concludes the following paragraph with that sentence:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“If memory remains sound and the thinking mind retains its vigor, an old intelligence may have extraordinary breadth and depth of understanding. It’s had time to gather knowledge and more practice in comparison and judgement. No matter if the knowledge is intellectual or practical or emotional, if it concerns alpine ecosystems or the Buddha nature or how to reassure a frightened child: when you meet an old person with that kind of knowledge, if you have the sense of a bean sprout you know you’re in a rare and irreproducible presence.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took me a really long while to realise one area where Beeminder really shines: It functions perfectly as a trigger for you to notice things. That goal you said you’d stick to? Well, you haven’t. And it won’t just fade into background, it will take 5 bucks from your wallet.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://ozan.ogreden.com/notebook/2021/04/shell-culture</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After years of “having to” and “fighting with”, I’m finally grokking shell scripting, I think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While trying to get &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/oguzhanogreden/dotfiles/blob/master/scripts/bmndr-tmin.sh&quot;&gt;a shell script&lt;/a&gt; to work on OhMyZsh. I vaguely though of a  scene from Where Wizards Stay Up Late. The main difference between the experience of the developers described there and my experience was that I never had to think of a “LOGIN” to be truncated to “LO” due to network issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never had to think of my programs as a stream of characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when I read the comment “Sorry, I should have thought about echoing the contents of course.” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/275797&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), it just made sense.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Two Histories, and Another One</title>
   <link href="https://ozan.ogreden.com/notebook/2021/04/19"/>
   <updated>2021-04-19T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
   <id>https://ozan.ogreden.com/notebook/2021/04/two-histories-broand-band-wizards</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.notion.so/Broad-Band-by-Claire-L-Evans-a1ec6dffff4940d6852e071210f0910e&quot;&gt;Broad Band&lt;/a&gt; by Claire L. Evans right after Where the Wizards Stay Up Late has been interesting so far. There’s a lot to of good things to be said about Broad Band, and I may do that once I’m through the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most striking differences is how they chose their frames. Reading Where Wizards Stay Up Late, you get to know two groups of people: the mighty wizards and the powerful man. It’s as much the story of the powerful man who paved a way as it is about mighty wizards who marched the paved path in their own inspiring, awkward and adorable manner. You get to imagine an ARPA director providing millions of dollars of funding. You get to forget the literal army of people that made this possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading Broad Band, you get the taste of a different story. It’s a balancing act. There are pointers to existing histories of the wizards, but you’re reading a &lt;em&gt;wider&lt;/em&gt; history. One in which women who had to persevere through sexism in some of its most hideous forms is at the center of the stage. You read stories of women who had to embrace a horrible kind of grind. Next to the very familiar kind of grind &lt;a href=&quot;https://jacobian.org/2021/apr/7/embrace-the-grind/&quot;&gt;that makes things possible&lt;/a&gt;&lt;!--[202104122020 Embrace the Grind] --&gt;, that makes them happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s then disappointing a bit when you see other faces through lines that you were just allowed to forget. When efforts that helped commit one of the most horrorful atrocities of our history gets credited as “saving time and lives.”&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How could I have done this for times faster?</title>
   <link href="https://ozan.ogreden.com/notebook/2021/04/17"/>
   <updated>2021-04-17T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
   <id>https://ozan.ogreden.com/notebook/2021/04/first-week</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s the end of my first week with &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/02/20/pivot-career-software/&quot;&gt;my new team&lt;/a&gt;. Towards the end of the week, I came across a Tweet:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Why couldn’t we deliver this 4 times faster is a good question for software development teams to be asking.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t find the Tweet, but If I recall correctly, the author meant to suggest this as a question that would help developers stretch their imagination and focus on their tooling. I took it a bit differently: It’s not a stretch for me to imagine that I will soon produce four times what I’ve produced this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at my week with this lens, what were the time sinkholes for me? Two things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’ve tested my solutions too many times.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I hadn’t read the documentation of my dependencies well enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve tested too many times primarily because conjuring a mental “infinite zoom overview” of my work has been difficult. Both on the backend with microservices and in the frontend with Angular, this slowed me down prohibitively. This was compounded by the fact that I’m far from having a solid knowledge of the many specifics of external dependencies, frameworks and in-house solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading documentation in a rushed way is a classic, of course. This was a case of “I just want this damn thing to be done” and I should’ve &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/04/11/very-recently/&quot;&gt;known better&lt;/a&gt;&lt;!--[[202104112132 (very) recently - post]]--&gt;. There isn’t much to do but to remind yourself that this does not save time, after all. Reading documentation may also be the only way to get confident with specifics of everything.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Presence, Absence, Computing</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(I thought this would become something better, it didn’t work out, but I have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.beeminder.com/oguzhanogreden/w-daily&quot;&gt;a promise&lt;/a&gt;!)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A non-controversial statement: Computing is about references.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’d like to refer to something that exists and do something with it. Now you can’t stop there: You need to be able to refer to non-existence, null. Maybe you are someone who can think of 0 as something other than a reference to non-existence. If you need to represent something electrically (utimately), you will need first and foremost have to distinguish presence and absence of electricity. If you find yourself in the sad profession of representing things electrically, you will realise that you need to give up. Forget about all those “other things 0 can be.” You will call “that doesn’t exist” 0 and “that exists” 1, and move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have 1, and 0 so that you can have 1, you have infinitely many references that you can use. That you are using.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon, the same will be there but will read “no-CV” and will link to this page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This comes from the realization that when I think of my CV, I think of a different thing than most. I would like to take &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; to my work. As this is my “CV”, it makes more sense for me to link you to it: &lt;a href=&quot;https://ozan.ogreden.com&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, which isn’t in a good state, but that’s not how it will stay!bb&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Spaced Repetition, Flinches / Ugh-Fields</title>
   <link href="https://ozan.ogreden.com/notebook/2021/04/13"/>
   <updated>2021-04-13T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
   <id>https://ozan.ogreden.com/notebook/2021/04/spaced-repetition-flinches-ugh-fields</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;About 15 months ago. I have started (re-)using Anki for expanding my Dutch vocabulary. After a few months of dutiful daily Anki practices, it had become a dull exercise. My search for Anki-revival tactics led me to Michael Nielsen’s essay &lt;a href=&quot;http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html&quot;&gt;Augmenting Long-term Memory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using Anki for topics other than language has been an interesting experience. For instance, engaging with a topic/material at regular but not always predictable intervals has been emotionally pleasing for me. This venue is actively researched by Andy Matuschak and you should check &lt;a href=&quot;https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=zUw5PuD8op9oq8kHvni6sug6eRTNtR9Wqma&amp;amp;stackedNotes=z4rRX3qwSSJRsEkdXKwH2shamgHNeRthrMLiF&quot;&gt;his work&lt;/a&gt; out if you’re into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just today I’ve run into a radically interesting use case at the intersection of spaced repetition and mental health. Internet is a small world, so this happens to be located on a blog that I distinctly remember visiting earlier: &lt;a href=&quot;http://becomingeden.com/developing-object-permanence-around-flinches/&quot;&gt;becomingeden.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/04/11/very-recently/&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;&lt;!--[[202104112132 (very) recently - post]]--&gt;, today has been generous with inspiring stuff, too.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>EBS for individuals</title>

   <updated>2021-04-12T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
   <id>https://ozan.ogreden.com/notebook/2021/04/individual-ebs</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve read Joel Spolsky’s Evidence Based Scheduling a while ago, thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.beeminder.com/t/20th-anniversary-of-the-joel-test-for-software-teams/7096/25&quot;&gt;a discussion&lt;/a&gt; in Beeminder forums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s written from the developer team management perspective. In it’s essence, Evidence Based Scheduling calibrates developers’ estimation performance so that realistic estimates can be obtained. (A key aspect of the method is that it also quantifies the confidence one may have in an estimate, but that’s besides the point.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think EBS may also be useful from the individual perspective. In the practice suggested by Joel, “velocities” that are older than 6 months discarded since estimators get better at estimating. Someone who’s early in their career could also get noticably better and faster in such a time span. A side effect of EBS data would then be making explicit if “5 story points” came to mean 8 days to 4 days, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://ozan.ogreden.com/2021/04/11/very-recently</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tmcw&quot;&gt;Tom MacWright’s&lt;/a&gt; Recently series, and to appease &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.beeminder.com/oguzhanogreden/w-posted&quot;&gt;Beeminder&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;notes-for-junior-developers&quot;&gt;Notes for junior developers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be starting working as a developer next week. As in any problem solving domain, problems I will get will have a few good and many bad solutions. My focus in this “first period” will be focusing on learning what makes a solution good, and when to make a trade-off for a worse solution for the sake of e.g. speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developing problem solving expertise is difficult. Surely, I will feel lost, tried and tried, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brainpickings.org/2012/10/15/when-charles-darwin-hated-everybody/&quot;&gt;hate everybody &amp;amp; everything&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s some advice from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dulcedejae/status/1366698180340047874&quot;&gt;jae anne&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1366728171534565376&quot;&gt;Dan Abramov&lt;/a&gt; on how to tackle this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, jae anne shouts a warning that anytime something works but you don’t understand it, you should treat it as it’s “not working” and your work not done. You just don’t give into the feeling of “I just want this damn thing to be done.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a sense, these are obvious. In another sense, it’s hard for me to tell “Up to which resolution should &lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt; understand what’s going on here?” before being able to use jae anne’s suggestion. That’s easier to do for me than following their advice, and is a pre-requisite too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;command-line-tools-that-compete-with-a-hadoop-cluster&quot;&gt;Command-line tools that compete with a Hadoop Cluster&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adam Drake wrote (many years ago) &lt;a href=&quot;https://adamdrake.com/command-line-tools-can-be-235x-faster-than-your-hadoop-cluster.html&quot;&gt;a short demo&lt;/a&gt; of what can be achieved with &lt;a href=&quot;https://brandur.org/small-sharp-tools&quot;&gt;small, sharp tools&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m pretty happy if I can pipe &lt;a href=&quot;https://parkbee.github.io/data-til/2020/11/05/find-and-replace-extension-regex/&quot;&gt;two shell commands&lt;/a&gt; (and not lose any file), while Adam goes on to parallelize operations and all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspiring stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;shorthand-for-shaping&quot;&gt;“Shorthand for shaping”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve always found shorthand a bit magical. In my own way, I have about 7 shortcuts defined for &lt;a href=&quot;https://espanso.org&quot;&gt;espanso&lt;/a&gt;. That’s all I have to say about shorthand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also custom (sometimes ad-hoc) shorthands that people use. Ryan Singer’s essay &lt;a href=&quot;https://world.hey.com/rjs/9-shorthand-for-shaping-cc672da1&quot;&gt;“Shorthand for shaping”&lt;/a&gt; is a short exposition of a custom shorthand of how he used a simple shorthand notation for thinking about a early stage design process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being someone who doesn’t know shorthand, neither designs anything, I found it pretty interesting to see that a sketch like this is part of the process:&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Looking for: Meta blub studies</title>
   <link href="https://ozan.ogreden.com/notebook/2021/04/08"/>
   <updated>2021-04-08T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
   <id>https://ozan.ogreden.com/notebook/2021/04/looking-for-meta-blub-studies</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Blub studies is not a very good &lt;a href=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/02/20/writing-advice/&quot;&gt;concept-handle&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not very clear what “blub” is. It is, however, a great meme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its shortest definition, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.benkuhn.net/blub/&quot;&gt;blub studies&lt;/a&gt; is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;the study of what goes on in the guts of these boring, everyday systems–not the kind you get tenure for inventing, but the kind people actually use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben Kuhn suggests “kickstarting ‘your blub flywheel’” however you can. He promises it will eventually pay off greatly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have an appetite for blub studies. And this sounds like a good advice to me.  I will heed it. Just like I followed the “Use Vim emulation in an IDE” advice, as a person with an appetite for keyboard-dominant interaction with my computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like there’s something missing. There must be a “blub-studies studies” level that we can rise to. At that level, we could ask and answer questions like: How to build appetite for blub-studies? How to get better at it? I don’t think I have come across this yet. Except perhaps in The Zen and Motorcycle Maintenance, or Philosophical Explanations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(This came my way thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jvns.ca&quot;&gt;Julia Evans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;!--[[202104041301 Julia Evans]]--&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ghulheim, a drawing by Neil Gaiman</title>
   <link href="https://ozan.ogreden.com/notebook/2021/04/05"/>
   <updated>2021-04-05T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
   <id>https://ozan.ogreden.com/notebook/2021/04/ghulheim</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Even from the path below Ghûlheim, even from miles away, Bod could see that all of the angles were wrong–that the walls sloped crazily, that it was every nightmare he had ever endured made into a place, like a huge mouth of jutting teeth. It was a city that had been built just to be abandoned, in which all the fears and madnesses and revulsions of the creatures who built it were made into stone. The ghoul-folk had found it and delighted in it and called it home. &lt;em&gt;(The Graveyard Book, Neil Gaiman)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a great description. I could attempt at a good sketch how Ghûlheim looks, and likely fail to caricaturize how Evil it looks. The wickedness of the city Neil Gaiman describes  is as pointy as it needs to be: it’s a good specimen of the familiar &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=dark+scary+town+illustration&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwj7mPHetufvAhXN2rsIHddlAZoQ2-cCegQIABAA&quot;&gt;Dark Scary Town Illustration&lt;/a&gt; with a touch of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=dark%20scary%20town%20illustration%20tim%20burton&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;tbs=rimg:CZ1leCtb2WFyYRNZA6gyR6Tg&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0CAIQrnZqFwoTCJj79tS35-8CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAC&amp;amp;biw=1265&amp;amp;bih=1313&quot;&gt;Tim Burton aesthetics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How to notice what you don't know?</title>
   <link href="https://ozan.ogreden.com/notebook/2021/04/04"/>
   <updated>2021-04-04T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
   <id>https://ozan.ogreden.com/notebook/2021/04/how-to-notice-what-you-dont-know</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Some authors make you feel lucky that you’re in their audience. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jvns.ca&quot;&gt;Julia Evans&lt;/a&gt; &lt;!--[[202104041301 Julia Evans]]--&gt; is one of those authors for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julia recently published &lt;a href=&quot;https://jvns.ca/blog/learn-how-things-work/&quot;&gt;“Get better at programming by learning how things work”&lt;/a&gt;. She has great advice that pairs well with Peter Norvig’s &lt;!--[[202104041304 Peter Norvig]]--&gt;’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://norvig.com/21-days.html&quot;&gt;recipe for programming success&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One question that she leaves open is “How do you figure out what you don’t know?” Here’s what’s been working for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trying to talk about the topic opens the portal for me. I find self-talking out loud effective. Initiating the talk with a hypothetical interview question is helpful here. For instance, “Can you explain how a Flexbox is laid out in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcUey-DVYjk&quot;&gt;5 levels&lt;/a&gt;?” If can come up with two levels, perhaps three, but not more, that’s a good sign. That usually tells me I’m at the “I can use this thing (and it will be okay).” level, borrowing Julia’s description.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I have the portal open, I need a good source. Then I’ll just read it with a specific goal: To make notes of concepts I don’t know, or statements that I wouldn’t be able to make myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the CSS example, I thought I’d be able to add another level by reading the CSS specification. (I was also curious why people seemed “scared” of them.) This was a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how it worked. A sentence &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/#flex-containers&quot;&gt;like&lt;/a&gt; “A flex container establishes a new flex formatting context for its contents. This is the same as establishing a block formatting context, except that flex layout is used instead of block layout.” brought up the following question:  What is a formatting context? I also noticed that I should probably know how block containers establish their formatting context. Or what kind of formatting context they establish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s another example. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/#visibility-collapse&quot;&gt;Reading&lt;/a&gt; “Though collapsed flex items aren’t rendered, they do appear in the formatting structure.” highlighted box in my mental model that I need to fill in. What is a formatting structure?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, this can get scary: The amount of notes I now have is overwhelming. Next to that, stepping into unknown territory makes one thing very hard: To make smart choices to reach your goal effectively. Which of this leads should I follow? At this point, I usually just make notes, and keep reading. I read until I have a sense of which leads are promising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could, of course, heed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/read.en.html&quot;&gt;the advice of the wise&lt;/a&gt; and learn everything. But that seems impractical for my needs.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Margaret Atwood's Foreword to The Graveyard Book</title>
   <link href="https://ozan.ogreden.com/notebook/2021/04/02"/>
   <updated>2021-04-02T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
   <id>https://ozan.ogreden.com/notebook/2021/04/atwood-graveyard-book</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The 10th anniversary edition of The Graveyard Book has a foreword by Margaret Atwood. The foreword is delightful. And it’s short. In five pages, she succinctly meanders through all I want from a forward: literary context, Gaiman’s place in that context, excitement about the story, and even a personal anectode that involved Gaiman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me try to give you a taste of the meandering yet to the point style of Atwood. Here’s where she makes a leap towards introducing the book:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Astrologically, Neil Gaiman is a Scorpio with Gemini rising, and, if you go in for that sort of thing - as he must, because I found his horoscope online - this explains much. Scorpio is governed by Pluto, patron of the Underworld as well as of plumbing, underwear, the criminal underworld, and everything below the line; and Gemini is ruled by Mercury or Hermes, god of thieves, jokes, communication, travel, and secrets; in addition to which he is the conductor of souls to the Underworld. Most travel to the land of the dead is one-way, but Hermes comes and goes as he pleases, and so do various protagonists in books by Neil Gaiman, including this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following paragraph opens with “Most of us have a distinct aversion to being dead. We have great difficulty imagining ourselves as simply not existing anymore: […]”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet we have tried to imagine this throuhout the history. Atwood then surveys a selection of ancient stories that attempt at an explanation and reminds: “But there are many other possibilities. […] It is this latter body of folklore that Neil Gaiman draws upon for The Graveyard Book.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fantastic!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Evaluation of LINQ can be deferred past the moment DbContext is disposed.</title>
   <link href="https://ozan.ogreden.com/til/deferred-execution-lazy-evaluation-disposed-error"/>
   <updated>2021-03-26T00:00:00+01:00</updated>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;That the .NET Core ecosystem brings the Language-Integrated Query (LINQ) of C# and Entity Framework Core provides a lot of comfort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One property of LINQ is that it defers execution of queries, if the return value of the query is a sequence of values.
This provides for flexibility in composing complex queries programatically without changing the way you compose the query.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some pitfalls of deferred execution, for instance it can cause degraded performance due to potential multiple enumeration.
I learned of another one that caught me by surprise:
If the execution is deferred long enough, resources that are needed for querying may be &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.idisposable?view=net-5.0&quot;&gt;disposed&lt;/a&gt; of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Searching the internet for “The operation cannot be completed because the DbContext has been disposed.” returns more than enough results, &lt;a href=&quot;The operation cannot be completed because the DbContext has been disposed&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; is one StackOverflow answer that I found useful.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Improving readability on web with typography basics</title>
   <link href="https://ozan.ogreden.com/2021/03/24/typography-font-size-scale-line-height/"/>
   <updated>2021-03-24T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>https://ozan.ogreden.com/2021/03/24/typography-font-size-scale-line-height</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What does your visitors first do when they land your webpage?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you what I do. I press down &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Command&lt;/code&gt; and hit &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; two times. Unless your page already looks like &lt;a href=&quot;https://ia.net&quot;&gt;iA’s home page&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid rgba(0, 134, 179, 0.15);&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2021-03-24-ia-light.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to represent how large those letters actually are with a screenshot.
(Especially since I stole their background color ;))
They are really large, go check it out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out, I’m not alone in my discontent about font size on web.
This became only more clear as I starting reading about web typography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some basic rules that I learned, that improved readability on this page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we start, &lt;strong&gt;a warning&lt;/strong&gt;: Writing about typography on a blog that’s still so poorly laid is a bit… painful.
Reading will be even more so.
I’m moving away from the Jekyll theme I started with, but things are in transition, so bear with me ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-its-a-matter-of-established-principles-not-taste&quot;&gt;1. It’s a matter of established principles, not taste.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You might ask “Why not just allow the user to choose the type size?” Well, adjusting type size is not a matter of taste, but a matter of reading distance. Since most websites and applications have an overly small type size, new customers would initially choose a type size that they are used to, that is: too small a size […]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;from &lt;a href=&quot;https://ia.net/topics/responsive-typography-the-basics&quot;&gt;Responsive Typography: The Basics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;!--[[202103162148 responsive typography the basics]]--&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oliver Reichenstein &lt;!--[[202103192305 Oliver Reichenstein]]--&gt; is quite clear in his post.
More about how to choose the size in a bit.
Before that… why in the first place did we get used to uncomfortably small type sizes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the answer is seems to be a bad alignment of stars in the industry.
Richard Rutter &lt;a href=&quot;https://alistapart.com/article/howtosizetextincss/#section3&quot;&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; that 16 pixels was often considered too large&lt;!--[[202103182126 how to size text in CSS]]--&gt;.
I’m not if this is still the case.
But in any case, if Rutter didn’t get what he wanted, it’s not surprising that most of the designers couldn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the default of 16 pixels seemed a good &lt;em&gt;starting point&lt;/em&gt; to me.
Starting there, I used the practical trick offered by Reichenstein:
Take a book and hold it at a comfortable reading distance.
Simultaneously, hold your digital device at it’s common use distance.
Make sure the physical sizes of letters are the same.
That is the correct size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this blog, I’ve chosen &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; sizes to base my typographic scales: 1.12rem and 1.25rem, for mobile and desktop.
Without overwriting the root font size, that’d be based on 16 pixels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-choose-a-modular-scale-not-one-size&quot;&gt;2. Choose a modular scale, not one size.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the sixteenth century, a series of common sizes developed among European typographers, and the series survived with little change and few additions for 400 years. […] Use the old familiar scale, or use new scales of your own devising, but limit yourself, at first, to a modest set of distinct and related intervals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Typographic_Style&quot;&gt;Elements of Typographic Style&lt;/a&gt;&lt;!--[[202103160852 elements of typography]]--&gt;, quoted in &lt;a href=&quot;http://webtypography.net/3.1.1&quot;&gt;Elements of Typography Applied To Web&lt;/a&gt;&lt;!--[[202103182109 elements of typography applied to web]]--&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is a “scale” when it comes to typography?
Well, it’s quiet similar to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(music)&quot;&gt;musical scale&lt;/a&gt;.
It’s a series of numbers that make up a coherent set around a base size.
The coherence provided by the scale helps your layout “make sense” to the observers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way of defining a typographic scale is choosing a “base size” and a multiplier, giving you a “modular scale”.
The multiplier defines the ratio of each point in the scale to the next.
For instance, a base size of 16px and a ratio of 2 would give you the scale: …, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, … 
One idea that I liked is that you can use the scale for determining not only the size of font elements, but also designing the whitespace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tim Brown’s&lt;!--[[202103182201 Tim Brown]]--&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.modularscale.com&quot;&gt;modularscale.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;!--[[202103182200 modularscale.com]]--&gt; is a nice tool for choosing (and quickly implementing) modular scales.
How to choose the ratio? In his post &lt;a href=&quot;https://alistapart.com/article/more-meaningful-typography/&quot;&gt;More Meaningful Typography&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;!--[[202103192149 More Meaningful Typography]]--&gt; Tim Brown gives an example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I chose the golden mean (1:1.618). It is a beautiful proportion with historical and cultural connections that make sense for the typefaces I’ve chosen and the text I’m setting. Although it is a contemporary design, Minion draws upon Renaissance ideals […]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not a designer, and neither am I well versed in typography.
So I find such judgements hard to make.
For this blog, I’ve chosen two ratios: 1:1.06 for mobile and 1:1.2 for desktop, primarily because they looked fine for some spacing I want to implement soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-use-unitless-responsive-line-heights&quot;&gt;3. Use unitless, responsive line heights.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Frank Chimero&lt;!--[[202103211711 Frank Chimero]]--&gt;, you can have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://frankchimero.com/blog/2020/redesign-this-design/&quot;&gt;“blog that’s superior to most with a couple lines of CSS”&lt;/a&gt;. One of those few lines is the CSS declaration: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;line-height: 1.5&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ideal line line height for &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; blog, however, also depends on the reading distance, like the base font size.
The key thing here seems to be that the line height should help “promote horizontal movement” and make the lines of text feel like “horizontal lines, not woven fabric”, as noted by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/09/balancing-line-length-font-size-responsive-web-design/&quot;&gt;Laura Franz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;!--[[202103232057 Size Matters Balancing the line length and font size in responsive design]]--&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the implementation side, the most surprising thing for me was the importance of &lt;a href=&quot;/til/using-unitless-lineheights-css&quot;&gt;using unitless line-heights&lt;/a&gt;,
as noted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2006/02/08/unitless-line-heights/&quot;&gt;Eric Meyer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found 1.9rem and 2.03rem to play nicely with mobile and desktop settings I’ve mentioned so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;there-is-more&quot;&gt;There is more…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you made it so far, here’s one more thing: the “measure”. Traditional wisdom suggests that your line width (or measure) should be 45-75 characters, or about 10 words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found a bit wider than 75 characters satisfying. And both Laura Franz (in her above linked blog post) and the iA folks (as reflected in their current choices) seem to agree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While choosing the measure, I found Vasilis van Gemert’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://vasilis.nl/nerd//code/measure-help/&quot;&gt;“international measure slider”&lt;/a&gt; and Chris Coyier’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://css-tricks.com/bookmarklet-colorize-text-45-75-characters-line-length-testing/&quot;&gt;bookmarklet&lt;/a&gt; to colorize 45-75 character range of text elements text run very helpful in being mindful about how precisely I went against traditional wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find that these tools make it more enjoyable to play with typography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, this is a field where our perceptual abilities, representation capacities of our devices and fanciful aesthetic judgements clash and combine. Reading about it, tinkering with a few tools, and then making up one’s own rules is a lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Using unitless line heights in CSS is preferred</title>
   <link href="https://ozan.ogreden.com/til/using-unitless-lineheights-css"/>
   <updated>2021-03-22T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>https://ozan.ogreden.com/til/using-unitless-lineheights-css</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve been reading about web typography and came across a post by Erik Meyer, &lt;a href=&quot;http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2006/02/08/unitless-line-heights/&quot;&gt;“Unitless line-heights”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you set the line height with a united value, the value will be computed and passed down to children.
For instance, setting the line height to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;1.5em&lt;/code&gt; for an element with font size of 16 points, means that the line height will be 24 points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This value will be passed down to any element under the hierarchy, not the raw value of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;1.5em&lt;/code&gt;.
Meaning that even a descendant with 12 points will get a line height of 24 points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, using a unitless line height (like &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;1.5&lt;/code&gt;) will make sure that each element will compute the line height to be 1.5 times their font.
This is preferable since line heights are very much font size dependent.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Why am I changing into a career in software?</title>
   <link href="https://ozan.ogreden.com/2021/03/10/why-change-career-software/"/>
   <updated>2021-03-10T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>https://ozan.ogreden.com/2021/03/10/why-change-career-software</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The answer boils down to one concept: craft. Wikipedia entry of the word is rather narrow in definition&lt;!--[[202103102009 wikipedia entry of craft]]--&gt;. It’s been more than 10 years that software has been described as one. And it’s not a stretch of imagination to consider writing another. Stretch a little and you will see a crafty element in a wide array of human activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crafty nature of software is in part why I’m switching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, this is a logical next step. Once, I aspired to be a cognitive psychology researcher. When it came to &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.3758/s13414-018-1560-5&quot;&gt;doing research&lt;/a&gt;, I chose for writing Python scripts for creating experiment materials and R to simulate participants. Instead of focusing on generating knowledge. And this kept going on &lt;a href=&quot;https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dcurver/index.html&quot;&gt;like this&lt;/a&gt;, well into my current position: working as a data scientist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “data scientist” title still covers really wide ground. One way of grouping data scientists is whether the position is a central role or a supportive role. The supportive role is the one I know closely: You support a business in solving a problem, but you are not at the core of the problem solution. If you’re craving for craft, you need to stretch yourself quite frequently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/02/20/pivot-career-software/&quot;&gt;would prefer&lt;/a&gt; less stretching and more craft.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A pivot: From data science to software development</title>
   <link href="https://ozan.ogreden.com/2021/02/20/pivot-career-software/"/>
   <updated>2021-02-20T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>https://ozan.ogreden.com/2021/02/20/pivot-career-software</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s official, I’m pivoting to a career in software development!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s funny but I didn’t see this coming so quickly!
Until 10 days ago, I’ve been thinking that my next career move would be going a sabbatical and starting a niche e-commerce company.
I have always liked these ideas and arrangements were mostly done, save for taking the leap itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combined with a lack of excitement about my job, that I couldn’t shake of despite &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/01/23/variational-inference/&quot;&gt;a few&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/01/08/dirichlet-processes-label-switching/&quot;&gt;attempts&lt;/a&gt;…
I was ‘dangerously’ close to the edge.
Then, a friend suggested &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dL7LBoGIHZM&quot;&gt;Pivot&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pivotmethod.com/&quot;&gt;Jenny Blake&lt;/a&gt;. 
Because she thought I was contemplating a sabbatical for the wrong reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk was a good trigger for an &lt;a href=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/03/24/should-you-reverse-any-advice-you-hear/&quot;&gt;advice reversal&lt;/a&gt; session, that led to my final decision.
Jenny Blake addresses people like me, directly:
those who think that a large step is needed for getting more satisfaction out of their career.
Her advice is quite the opposite, though.
She suggests doubling down on what works, and taking a small step.
A small step to reorient oneself, and face a different path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking about it, I realised I wanted to try my hand at software development.
And last week, I internally announced my plans of switching from my data science role to a software development role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a lot to learn, a lot to experience and a lot of ideas - I’m excited!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Basics of variational inference - theory</title>
   <link href="https://ozan.ogreden.com/2021/01/23/variational-inference/"/>
   <updated>2021-01-23T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>https://ozan.ogreden.com/2021/01/23/variational-inference</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Switching to a Bayesian workflow can be frustrating initially, when the sampling speed becomes limiting and you have no idea why.
Like it happened to me &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/01/08/dirichlet-processes-label-switching/&quot;&gt;when I tried to fit a Dirichlet process mixture model&lt;/a&gt; &lt;!-- [[202012161651 dirichlet process post]] --&gt; using PyMC3.
Any attempt at working around the difficulties I ran into got blocked by the speed of NUTS sampler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that variational inference (VI) can help in these stages.
However, it seems to have its own peculiarities and even some pitfalls.
Not having learned about VI during my master’s, I set out to read about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VI is a method for approximating probability densities&lt;!-- [[202101121750 Variational Inference A Review For Statisticians]] --&gt;.
In the context of Bayesian modeling, we can use it to approximate the posterior.
As such, we can consider it an alternative to markov chain monte carlo (MCMC) algorithms.
There is one important advantage of VI: it’s very fast compared to MCMC.
And there is an important disadvantage: you don’t get to be sure that the approximation will give you what you’re looking for, unlike with MCMC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with remembering what we’re looking for in Bayesian inference problem: the posterior, or the density of model parameters conditional on the data. Mathematically speaking:&lt;/p&gt;

\[p(z | x)\]

&lt;p&gt;Commonly used modern methods for getting to the posterior are based on sampling, a.k.a markov chain monte carlo algorithms.
VI, on the other hand, approaches the problem from an optimisation point of view, by making use of a clever trick.
Before we get to the trick, let’s specify the objective of the optimisation: Kullbeck-Leibler (KL) divergence &lt;!-- [[202101121805 Kullbeck-Leibler divergence]] --&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kullbeck-Leibler divergence is a measure if the “difference in information contained within two distributions” &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.
In the VI context, specifically, the KL divergence from the posterior to the approximating density is relevant:  \(KL( q(\mathbf{z}) \| p(\mathbf{z} \vert \mathbf{x} ) )\)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buried in this divergence is a term that’s very difficult to evaluate: \(p(\boldsymbol{x})\).
The trick is to optimise for another objective which is (1) easier to evaluate and (2) is equivalent to minimising the KL divergence: Evidence lower bound (ELBO).&lt;/p&gt;

\[ELBO(q) = \mathbb{E}[logp(\mathbf{z}, \mathbf{x})] - \mathbb{E}[logq(\mathbf{z})]\]

&lt;p&gt;Blei et al. (2018) note that “the variational objective mirrors the usual balance between likelihood and prior” &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;!-- [[202101121750 Variational Inference A Review For Statisticians]] --&gt; and this is visible once the identity is rearranged:&lt;/p&gt;

\[ELBO(q) = \mathbb{E}[logp(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{z})] + KL(q(\mathbf{z})||p(\mathbf{z}))\]

&lt;p&gt;Great. But how do we specify \(q\)? A commonly used family of probability distributions is “mean-field variational family”. The mean-field variational family is essentially a joint distribution of independent random variables.
So we have:&lt;/p&gt;

\[q(\boldsymbol{z}) = \prod_{j=1}^{m}q_j(z_j).\]

&lt;p&gt;This makes one of the key properties of VI with mean-field family clear: &lt;strong&gt;we’re assuming that model parameters are mutually independent&lt;/strong&gt;.
If they are correlated, the approximation will not be able to capture that information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, we need an optimisation algorithm and we’re ready to go. I’ll refer you to Blei et al. (2018) &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; for the details, where you can read about coordinate ascent mean-field variational inference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let’s turn to what’s happening when we use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.pymc.io/notebooks/variational_api_quickstart.html&quot;&gt;variational API of PyMC3&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3/blob/aedc8e9006c7e672e461774a5ee095562405c99c/pymc3/variational/inference.py#L732-L741&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; you can see that the default of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;method=&lt;/code&gt; parameter is ADVI (automatic differentiation variational inference). ADVI is an algorithm that can express a given probabilistic model as an optimisation problem. The significant advantage of it is that we don’t have to think about technical requirements that we need to satisfy to make the approximation work. Any model we can write in PyMC3 (also Stan) can be run through ADVI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equipped with the magic provided by PyMC3 and with a basic understanding of variational inference.
It’s time to see it in practice!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Writing is too important to not practice until needed</title>
   <link href="https://ozan.ogreden.com/2021/01/08/writing/"/>
   <updated>2021-01-08T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>https://ozan.ogreden.com/2021/01/08/writing</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;!-- 202012062149 --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tldr: I set a writing goal for 2021.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was around 18, I had serendipitious online interactions that nudged the course of my life in important ways.
Most of these happened thanks to the online presence of others: scientists with blogs, professionals with their own websites or someone’s presence in an online community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a reminder recently: I ran into someone online.
They were able to quickly check out this website, as well as my lightweight &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ozanogred_en/&quot;&gt;Twitter account&lt;/a&gt; and responded: “Quickly checked your website and Twitter and I love your work!” (This happened at a point when I don’t have anything significant that would count as “my work”.
&lt;!-- This is one of the good reasons to stick to it via a Beeminder goal [[202012051524]]]. --&gt; )
We had a cup of coffee it was indeed really nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past years, I have been allowing too little of such coincidences.
I’d like to try and reverse that by writing more and attending to my online presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing seems to become increasingly more important for getting work done, as well.
It’s sometimes painfully obvious that textual communication is hard to do effectively.
In these cases, &lt;strong&gt;there is not much to do but write better&lt;/strong&gt;.
From this point of view, it makes sense that a strong emphasis on writing is expressed by the likes of Teamflow [&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;] and Gumroad [&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, I’ve been thinking of set up an e-commerce shop to test an idea.
In the first phase of such an endeavour, I need to be able to write decent quality copy so that I can express the idea and meet my customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering all these, &lt;strong&gt;one of my goals for 2021 is to practice writing&lt;/strong&gt;. By the end of the year, I’d like to see one or two pieces that I can be proud of, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.beeminder.com/oguzhanogreden/w-posted&quot;&gt;a few dozens of pieces written for practice purposes&lt;/a&gt;. There is one rule: I’m not allowed to indulge in navel-gazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/posts/&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is what I have so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

Better, we make this thinking available internally so that everyone can benefit and contribute to it.” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.notion.so/Teamflow-s-Culture-8f24be7f619a4e4aa7e93ba02d58cf4c&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Everyone writes well, and writes &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt;.” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20210107174327/https://sahillavingia.com/work&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Dirichlet Processes, MCMC frustrations and a direction ahead</title>

   <updated>2021-01-08T00:00:00+01:00</updated>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Put blandly, a Dirichlet process is a stochastic process whose realisations are probability distributions. It has two parameters: a base distribution and a scaling parameter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Bayesian statistics, the Dirichlet Process is useful when modeling, for instance, a random variable which has a mixture of normal distributions and we aren’t sure how many components are involved. As such, it is a nonparametric Bayesian model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently had a problem at work that I though could be solved by modeling it as a Dirichlet Process, but I didn’t feel confident enough and solved it using a few linear regression models. What’s a better excuse to practise some &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/01/08/writing/&quot;&gt;writing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;!--[[202012062149]]--&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s quickly visit the notation for a Dirichlet Process. A random variable $Y$ is a Dirichlet process:&lt;/p&gt;

\[Y \sim DP(N, \alpha)\]

&lt;p&gt;where $N$ stands for normal distribution and $\alpha$ is the scaling parameter of the Dirichlet process. $\alpha$ has a natural interpretation: The lower the value, the less spread realisations of $Y$ will be around $N$. In the context of mixture distributions, $\alpha$ conveys information as to how many components there will be in the mixture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let’s consider the following made up case: We’re asked to model the number of cars that enter the city of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utrecht_(province)&quot;&gt;Utrecht&lt;/a&gt; per hour. The stakeholders involved are the city planners and they know that the average number of cars that enter the city can be modeled by using &lt;em&gt;period of day&lt;/em&gt;. For instance, the average in the morning hours might be:&lt;/p&gt;

\[y_{morning} \sim N(\mu_{morning}, \sigma)\]

&lt;p&gt;In the noon, however, the location of the normal distribution will shift to $\mu_{noon}$ &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s also suppose that they’re willing to reconsider their definitions for &lt;em&gt;period of day&lt;/em&gt;, and would like to see what the data has to tell them. So part of our task is to summarise the evidence on this matter: The analysis should be flexible with respect to however many time periods there are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could approach this problem with the following model:&lt;/p&gt;

\[y \sim \sum_{i=1}^K w_i * N(\mu_i, 1 / {\tau_{i}\lambda_{i}})\]

&lt;p&gt;where we’d split the day into $K$ time periods, each time period would be modeled by a different normal distribution $N(\mu_i, 1 / {\tau_{i}\lambda_{i}})$ and each data point would belong to one of these with probability $w_i$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s build up the components of this model. Since we want to time periods to be similar to each other in terms of average number of cars, we’ll estimate $\mu_i$ by using an intercept only linear model,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll use the Dirichlet process for modeling $w_i$s:&lt;/p&gt;

\[w_i = \beta_i \prod_{j=1}^{i-1} (1-\beta_j)\]

&lt;p&gt;where&lt;/p&gt;

\[\beta_1, \ldots , \beta_K \sim Beta(1, \alpha)\]

\[\alpha \sim Gamma(1, 1)\]

&lt;p&gt;are the parameters for the Dirichlet process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can get this far by simply following &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.pymc.io/notebooks/dp_mix.html&quot;&gt;the relevant PyMC3 documentation&lt;/a&gt;. When learning something like this, building up the conceptual understanding up to this basic point and playing with an example is a good method, I think. So let’s make sure we can actually make sense of model output based on what we understood so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;dummy-example&quot;&gt;Dummy example&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s create some data with a structure that will make the job easy for this kind of model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;generator = np.random.default_rng()
size = 30

dat_count = np.vstack([
    generator.poisson(lam=750, size=(size, 1)), # morning
    generator.poisson(lam=500, size=(size, 1)), # noon
    generator.poisson(lam=250, size=(size, 1)), # evening
])

dat_period = np.vstack([
    np.asarray([&quot;morning&quot;] * size),
    np.asarray([&quot;noon&quot;] * size),
    np.asarray([&quot;evening&quot;] * size),
]).reshape(-1, 1)

dat = np.hstack([
    dat_count,
    dat_period
])

df_count = pd.DataFrame(dat, columns=[&quot;count&quot;, &quot;period&quot;], )
df_count[&quot;count&quot;] = df_count[&quot;count&quot;].astype(int)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a dataset with three, clearly distinct groups:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/Pasted image 20210108215604.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can standardise the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;count&lt;/code&gt; column and we have our $y$:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;count_mean = df_count[&quot;count&quot;].mean()
count_sd = df_count[&quot;count&quot;].std()
df_count[&quot;count_std&quot;] = (df_count[&quot;count&quot;] - count_mean) / count_sd
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the tutorial, we can fit a Dirichlet Process model like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;K = 30

def stick_breaking(beta):
    portion_remaining = tt.concatenate([[1], tt.extra_ops.cumprod(1 - beta)[:-1]])
    
    return beta * portion_remaining

with pm.Model() as m:
    alpha = pm.Gamma(&quot;alpha&quot;, 1, 1)
    beta = pm.Beta(&quot;beta&quot;, 1, alpha, shape=K) 
    w = pm.Deterministic(&quot;w&quot;, stick_breaking(beta))
    
    tau = pm.Gamma(&quot;tau&quot;, 1.0, 1.0, shape=K)
    lambda_ = pm.Gamma(&quot;lambda_&quot;, 10.0, 1.0, shape=K)
    mu = pm.Normal(&quot;mu&quot;, mu=0, tau=tau * lambda_, shape=K)
    
    obs = pm.NormalMixture(
        &quot;obs&quot;, w, mu, tau=lambda_ * tau, observed=y[&quot;count_std&quot;].values
    )
	
with m:
    trace = pm.sample(500, tune=500, chains=3, cores=3, init=&quot;advi&quot;, target_accept=.875) 	
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll jump over the model checks… since at this point I went into a rabbit hole that swallowed my hours. The rabbit I chased looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/Pasted image 20210108220312.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How is it possible that for instance component 2 is multimodel, while I specified it as a normal distribution? This is yet another way of observing what’s called &lt;strong&gt;label switching&lt;/strong&gt;. This isn’t big of a concern if you’re after the marginal density. But is a bit of an issue if you’re after clustering your data points into these components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out, fitting Dirichlet Process mixtures is rather hard. And hard problems in Bayesian statistics are really frustrating when you’re not experienced with the model you’re working, because you may need to wait 30 minutes to get a result that you can’t even use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There seem to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/1087&quot;&gt;different&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://discourse.pymc.io/t/properly-sampling-mixture-models/986/2&quot;&gt;ways&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/420348&quot;&gt;dealing&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;https://discourse.pymc.io/t/difficulties-fitting-a-mixture-of-dirichlet-distributions/5810/3?u=ozanogreden&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pivmet/vignettes/Relabelling_in_Bayesian_mixtures_by_pivotal_units.html&quot;&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt;, which I’d like to get back to soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before that, however, I’ll turn to something else that I came to know while I was reading about this problem: variational inference. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.codingpaths.com/&quot;&gt;Sayam Kumar&lt;/a&gt; has talk on this topic titled “&lt;a href=&quot;https://discourse.pymc.io/t/demystifying-variational-inference-by-sayam-kumar/6022&quot;&gt;Demystifying Variational Inference&lt;/a&gt; which he advertises with the following questions &lt;em&gt;“What will you do if MCMC is taking too long to sample? Also what if the dataset is huge? Is there any other cost-effective method for finding the posterior that can save us and potentially produce similar results?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More on variational inference to come!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Number of cars is a discrete non-negative random variable, so we can model it with a Poisson likelihood. However, fitting a Dirichlet Process mixture with Poisson likelihood proved terribly difficult. More in the remainder of the text. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Bayesian change point analysis using PyMC3</title>
   <link href="https://ozan.ogreden.com/2020/12/19/switchpoint-analysis-pymc3/"/>
   <updated>2020-12-19T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>https://ozan.ogreden.com/2020/12/19/switchpoint-analysis-pymc3</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I earlier wrote about how &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/12/05/beeminder-flossing/&quot;&gt;Beeminder helped me make a flossing habit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;!-- [[202011260914 beeminder black friday post about flossing]] --&gt;. In that post, I also touched upon a small “experiment” I made by decreasing my flossing commitment in Beeminder to see if I could keep the habit up &lt;!-- [[202011260836]] --&gt; - a friend of mine had put her faith in me that I can.
I failed her. But I’m a regular flosser these days, so there’s that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meanwhile, I had an assignment at work where I needed a simple Bayesian model. I chose to use PyMC3, and not having used it before, I read a lot of documentation and worked out a few toy examples. During these exercises, I also analysed the said experiment. Here’s how that went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, here’s what the data looked like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/Pasted image 20201219135858.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s pretty obvious that my flossing rate has changed around half of October. My goal was to reach this conclusion more formally, using PyMC3. It’s not the most exciting analysis, and the solution is borrowed from a StackOverflow answer &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, but it makes for good &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/01/08/writing/&quot;&gt;writing exercise&lt;/a&gt; &lt;!-- [[202012062149]] --&gt; (and I now also have a Beeminder goal that forces me to write things here&lt;!-- [[202012170753]] --&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I needed some data processing to obtain my flossing rate by using &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pandas.date_range&lt;/code&gt; and a join. Once the data is ready, the PyMC3 code for the model looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;df&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;flossing_data&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# Priors
&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sigma&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;HalfCauchy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'sigma'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;beta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;testval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;1.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;switch_lower&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;index&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;min&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;trace&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sample&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;step&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;step1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;step2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;progressbar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;cores&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;tune&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The parameter of interest was “switchpoint” and here’s how the posterior samples for this parameter looked, alongside the data itself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/Pasted image 20201219141317.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The model hedged its bet around the 48th day. Remarkably, the 94% probability range covers 17th to 74th day. This is largely due to the uninformative prior on the switchpoint parameter. We could have done better by specifying a prior that are a bit more informative and reduce the weight on the earlier and the later days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next to the parameter of interest, the “Intercept_u1” and “Intercept_u2” parameters could be interpreted as the daily rates of flossing and before and after the switchpoint, respectively:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/Pasted image 20201219142108.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the rate with which I flossed seemed to have decreased. In fact, we can test the hypothesis directly using the posterior samples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;posterior_intercepts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pm_data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;posterior&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Intercept_u1&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Intercept_u2&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;to_dataframe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;h_u1_gt_u2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;posterior_intercepts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Intercept_u1&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;posterior_intercepts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Intercept_u2&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;h_u1_gt_u2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mean&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# &amp;gt; 0.93925
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the data, the probability that I flossed more while using Beeminder than in the period I haven’t used it is 94%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a neat, albeit a trivial, example. I did learn a few elementary details about Bayesian estimation using PyMC3 in the process and it served me as a writing exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- I have a special interest in making small-to-mid-size businesses automate &quot;graph interpretation&quot; aspects of their work using statistical models (#incomplete write about this?). --&gt;

&lt;!-- Technical notes: --&gt;
&lt;!-- - &quot;Sampling Error: Bad initial energy&quot; roughly translates to &quot;Something wrong while evaluating the likelihood of initial values.&quot; and can be debugged with `Model.check_test_point()`. The term energy is used here since ??? #incomplete since energy is the concept that Hamiltonian Monte Carlo uses [[202012090733]]  to ??? #incomplete . I had the warning because I specified priors with no breadth. --&gt;

   <title>Beeminder: the commitment device that helps me stick to habits</title>
   <link href="https://ozan.ogreden.com/2020/12/05/beeminder-flossing/"/>
   <updated>2020-12-05T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>https://ozan.ogreden.com/2020/12/05/beeminder-flossing</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;!-- 202011260914 --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the products I use had an interesting Black Friday deal: The users would publish a promotion and get month(s) of premium for free. I really like the product and liked the idea of paying one month less. I’m not used to writing, however, so I missed the deadline. I’ll go ahead and post this anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- [Montaigne's warm warning](/2020/12/05/montaigne-warning/) holds for whoever's reading this. This is about me, and how I figured out a way of sticking to flossing. As such, it's obviously not useful for many. --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is so much online content about habits&lt;!-- [[202011260821]] --&gt;. This note will be part of that pile, but I actually don’t think I have much to add: I have a long record of failures, even for a trivial habit like flossing&lt;!-- [[202011260825]] --&gt;. I managed finally, though, and I will write how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge I had with flossing is particularly interesting for me, since I have been able to change all sorts of things in my life so far&lt;!-- [[202011301152]] --&gt;. Some of these changes were, some emotionally challenging and a few once unimaginable. Why does flossing my teeth almost every night is so difficult, of all things?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think there are two reasons&lt;!-- [[202012010631]] --&gt;. The first is that there is no immediate feedback when I don’t floss. In addition, I engage in something similar to moral licensing: I’m often busy with a few new things that challenge me throughout a day, I buckle down and apply myself. By the time I need to floss, I’m inclined to think “Oh I’ll do it tomorrow, today has been long.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first reason doesn’t need tackling: I already know flossing is better for me. How to tackle the-moral-licensing-like-decisions, though? This is where Beeminder is helpful&lt;!-- [[202012020814]]  [perhaps even at a meta level? [[202012020827]]--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beeminder is a commitment device&lt;!-- [[202012020845]] --&gt;. You set goals, it helps you stick to them. At the very core of most my Beeminder goals are two things: What do I want to do? And how often? [&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;] For any goal, these are often clear. Deciding how often to floss is trivial: The more evenings of a week the better (ask your dentist though).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what happens once I set a goal like “Flossing, 5 times/week”: If I don’t stick to the frequency I’ve set, Beeminder will take $5 from my wallet. To make sure they don’t take my money without good reason, they’ll be annoyingly persistent at sending notifications to my phone. If I already flossed that day, I’ll respond to notification using their app. That’s all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After months of Beeminding flossing, I need Beeminder’s push less and frequently. Nevertheless, nearing the 7 months of this commitment, I still have days where I would &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; floss if not for Beeminder. In fact, I tried getting rid of the Beeminder after a chat with a friend, to see if I would keep up the habit. Although I did keep flossing, my frequency went down&lt;!-- [[202011260836]] --&gt;. After all, using Beeminder was effective for me for consistently flossing. So I went back to using it to make sure I stick to my commitment. And my dentist doesn’t care if it’s a “habit” or something I do because an app triggers me, as long as I keep flossing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;1: Other measures are possible too: How many steps? How many words? How little work hours? How many kilograms? &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Transparent Companies</title>
   <link href="https://ozan.ogreden.com/2020/09/06/transparent-companies/"/>
   <updated>2020-09-06T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
   <id>https://ozan.ogreden.com/2020/09/06/transparent-companies</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve spent some time thinking about transparency in business in the past months.
I ~am~ got very close to starting my own e-commerce company to play with some of these ideas (more on that later).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a list of companies that have helped shape my imagination in how transparency in business can look like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;buffer.com&lt;/strong&gt;: Their company value number 1 is &lt;a href=&quot;https://buffer.com/about&quot;&gt;“Default to transparency.”&lt;/a&gt;. Specifically, they excel at communicating their &lt;a href=&quot;https://buffer.com/resources/salary-formula-changes-2019/&quot;&gt;salary formula&lt;/a&gt;, sharing their &lt;a href=&quot;https://buffer.com/resources/shareholder-update-q2-2020-and-july/&quot;&gt;board updates&lt;/a&gt; and have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://buffer.com/revenue&quot;&gt;revenue dashboard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;gitlab.com&lt;/strong&gt;: One of their company values is &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#transparency&quot;&gt;“Transparency”&lt;/a&gt;. They write in exhaustive detail about their &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.gitlab.com/company/okrs/&quot;&gt;OKRs&lt;/a&gt;, their &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.gitlab.com/company/strategy/&quot;&gt;strategy&lt;/a&gt; and also how they go about &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/ceo/cadence/#strategy&quot;&gt;strategizing&lt;/a&gt; and have an excellent &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/hiring/&quot;&gt;hiring&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;hellocode.com&lt;/strong&gt;: This is a small software shop working on &lt;a href=&quot;https://exist.io/&quot;&gt;Exist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://larder.io/&quot;&gt;Larder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://changemap.co/&quot;&gt;Changemap&lt;/a&gt;. They have a stats page which outlines their &lt;a href=&quot;https://hellocode.co/stats/&quot;&gt;financial situation&lt;/a&gt;. On their blog, you can read their &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.hellocode.co/post/exist-in-2020/&quot;&gt;2020 plans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;baremetrics.com&lt;/strong&gt;: They &lt;a href=&quot;https://baremetrics.com/blog/inside-our-financials-baremetrics-demo&quot;&gt;demo their product&lt;/a&gt; with their own company metrics and they do that &lt;a href=&quot;https://baremetrics.com/blog/inside-our-financials-baremetrics-demo&quot;&gt;with an attitude&lt;/a&gt;. They have a list of “open startups” but not all of the companies listed here have a focus on transparency.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;friendly.is&lt;/strong&gt;: Friendly is one of the startups I’ve come to know via Baremetrics, one of their company values is &lt;a href=&quot;https://friendly.is/en/manifesto&quot;&gt;“Default to transparency.”&lt;/a&gt;. They keep their revenue dashboard, website analytics and their product backlog &lt;a href=&quot;https://friendly.is/en/open&quot;&gt;public&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some more can be here:&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Useful Blog Posts On Data Science Job Market</title>

   <id>https://ozan.ogreden.com/2019/10/02/data-science-job-hunt</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As of September 2nd, I’ve been working at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.parkbee.nl&quot;&gt;ParkBee&lt;/a&gt;. While looking for this position, I revisited some of the data science job search material on the internet. In the meanwhile, I realized these are often not very well known by my peers, especially by those who can benefit from them. So here’s the starter kit for anyone who may be interested:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://veekaybee.github.io/2019/02/13/data-science-is-different/&quot;&gt;Data science is different now&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;Vicky Boykis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mpopov.com/blog/advice-for-grads-entering-industry-datasci&quot;&gt;Advice for graduates applying for data science jobs&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;Mikhail Popov&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is not strictly about data science positions, but it helped me evaluate the few interviews I had so far:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jacobian.org/2018/nov/29/annotated-interview-kickoff-script/&quot;&gt;My interview kickoff script, annotated&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;Jacob-Kaplan Moss&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Moody Humans was a simple “mood logging using scientific measurement tools” project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I primarily wanted to have some experience with web development using Vue.
The backend is built using Django.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fanciest feature of Moody Humans is that it’s integrated to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.openhumans.org&quot;&gt;Open Humans&lt;/a&gt;.
Which opens up the benefits of OpenHumans ecosystem, chief among them being the personal data notebooks.&lt;/p&gt;
