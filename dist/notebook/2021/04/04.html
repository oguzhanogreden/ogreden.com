She has great advice that pairs well with Peter Norvig’s <!--[[202104041304 Peter Norvig]]-->’s <a href="http://norvig.com/21-days.html">recipe for programming success</a>.</p> <p>One question that she leaves open is “How do you figure out what you don’t know?” Here’s what’s been working for me.</p> <p>Trying to talk about the topic opens the portal for me. I find self-talking out loud effective. Initiating the talk with a hypothetical interview question is helpful here. For instance, “Can you explain how a Flexbox is laid out in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcUey-DVYjk">5 levels</a>?” If can come up with two levels, perhaps three, but not more, that’s a good sign. That usually tells me I’m at the “I can use this thing (and it will be okay).” level, borrowing Julia’s description.</p> <p>Once I have the portal open, I need a good source. Then I’ll just read it with a specific goal: To make notes of concepts I don’t know, or statements that I wouldn’t be able to make myself.</p> <p>In the CSS example, I thought I’d be able to add another level by reading the CSS specification. (I was also curious why people seemed “scared” of them.) This was a good idea.</p> <p>Here’s how it worked. A sentence <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/#flex-containers">like</a> “A flex container establishes a new flex formatting context for its contents. This is the same as establishing a block formatting context, except that flex layout is used instead of block layout.” brought up the following question: What is a formatting context? I also noticed that I should probably know how block containers establish their formatting context. Or what kind of formatting context they establish.</p> <p>Here’s another example. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/#visibility-collapse">Reading</a> “Though collapsed flex items aren’t rendered, they do appear in the formatting structure.” highlighted box in my mental model that I need to fill in. What is a formatting structure?</p> <p>After all, this can get scary: The amount of notes I now have is overwhelming. Next to that, stepping into unknown territory makes one thing very hard: To make smart choices to reach your goal effectively. Which of this leads should I follow? At this point, I usually just make notes, and keep reading. I read until I have a sense of which leads are promising.</p> <p>I could, of course, heed <a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/read.en.html">the advice of the wise</a> and learn everything. But that seems impractical for my needs.</p> </div> </article> </main> </body> </html>
