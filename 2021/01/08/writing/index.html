Most of these happened thanks to the online presence of others: scientists with blogs, professionals with their own websites or someone’s presence in an online community.</p> <p>I had a reminder recently: I ran into someone online. They were able to quickly check out this website, as well as my lightweight <a href="https://twitter.com/ozanogred_en/">Twitter account</a> and responded: “Quickly checked your website and Twitter and I love your work!” (This happened at a point when I don’t have anything significant that would count as “my work”. <!-- This is one of the good reasons to stick to it via a Beeminder goal [[202012051524]]]. --> ) We had a cup of coffee it was indeed really nice.</p> <p>In the past years, I have been allowing too little of such coincidences. I’d like to try and reverse that by writing more and attending to my online presence.</p> <p>Writing seems to become increasingly more important for getting work done, as well. It’s sometimes painfully obvious that textual communication is hard to do effectively. In these cases, <strong>there is not much to do but write better</strong>. From this point of view, it makes sense that a strong emphasis on writing is expressed by the likes of Teamflow [<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>] and Gumroad [<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>].</p> <p>In addition, I’ve been thinking of set up an e-commerce shop to test an idea. In the first phase of such an endeavour, I need to be able to write decent quality copy so that I can express the idea and meet my customers.</p> <p>Considering all these, <strong>one of my goals for 2021 is to practice writing</strong>. By the end of the year, I’d like to see one or two pieces that I can be proud of, and <a href="https://www.beeminder.com/oguzhanogreden/w-posted">a few dozens of pieces written for practice purposes</a>. There is one rule: I’m not allowed to indulge in navel-gazing.</p> <p><a href="/posts/">Here</a> is what I have so far.</p> <hr /> <div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"> <ol> <li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote"> <p>“2.1 Thinking on paper: When confronted with a problem, we decompose it into parts; read the folks who dedicated their lives to it; and “think on paper” about it. Better, we make this thinking available internally so that everyone can benefit and contribute to it.” (<a href="https://www.notion.so/Teamflow-s-Culture-8f24be7f619a4e4aa7e93ba02d58cf4c">link</a>) <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote"> <p>“How we work &gt; Instead of having meetings, people “talk” to each other via GitHub, Notion, and (occasionally) Slack, expecting responses within 24 hours. Because there are no standups or “syncs” and some projects can involve expensive feedback loops to collaborate, working this way requires clear and thoughtful communication. Everyone writes well, and writes <em>a lot</em>.” (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210107174327/https://sahillavingia.com/work">link</a>) <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> </ol> </div> </div> </article> </main> </body> </html>
