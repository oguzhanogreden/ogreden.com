I really like the product and liked the idea of paying one month less. I‚Äôm not used to writing, however, so I missed the deadline. I‚Äôll go ahead and post this anyway.</p> <!-- [Montaigne's warm warning](/2020/12/05/montaigne-warning/) holds for whoever's reading this. This is about me, and how I figured out a way of sticking to flossing. As such, it's obviously not useful for many. --> <p>‚Äì</p> <p>There is so much online content about habits<!-- [[202011260821]] -->. This note will be part of that pile, but I actually don‚Äôt think I have much to add: I have a long record of failures, even for a trivial habit like flossing<!-- [[202011260825]] -->. I managed finally, though, and I will write how.</p> <p>The challenge I had with flossing is particularly interesting for me, since I have been able to change all sorts of things in my life so far<!-- [[202011301152]] -->. Some of these changes were, some emotionally challenging and a few once unimaginable. Why does flossing my teeth almost every night is so difficult, of all things?</p> <p>I think there are two reasons<!-- [[202012010631]] -->. The first is that there is no immediate feedback when I don‚Äôt floss. In addition, I engage in something similar to moral licensing: I‚Äôm often busy with a few new things that challenge me throughout a day, I buckle down and apply myself. By the time I need to floss, I‚Äôm inclined to think ‚ÄúOh I‚Äôll do it tomorrow, today has been long.‚Äù</p> <p>The first reason doesn‚Äôt need tackling: I already know flossing is better for me. How to tackle the-moral-licensing-like-decisions, though? This is where Beeminder is helpful<!-- [[202012020814]] [perhaps even at a meta level? [[202012020827]]--></p> <p>Beeminder is a commitment device<!-- [[202012020845]] -->. You set goals, it helps you stick to them. At the very core of most my Beeminder goals are two things: What do I want to do? And how often? [<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>] For any goal, these are often clear. Deciding how often to floss is trivial: The more evenings of a week the better (ask your dentist though).</p> <p>Here‚Äôs what happens once I set a goal like ‚ÄúFlossing, 5 times/week‚Äù: If I don‚Äôt stick to the frequency I‚Äôve set, Beeminder will take $5 from my wallet. To make sure they don‚Äôt take my money without good reason, they‚Äôll be annoyingly persistent at sending notifications to my phone. If I already flossed that day, I‚Äôll respond to notification using their app. That‚Äôs all.</p> <p>After months of Beeminding flossing, I need Beeminder‚Äôs push less and frequently. Nevertheless, nearing the 7 months of this commitment, I still have days where I would <em>not</em> floss if not for Beeminder. In fact, I tried getting rid of the Beeminder after a chat with a friend, to see if I would keep up the habit. Although I did keep flossing, my frequency went down<!-- [[202011260836]] -->. After all, using Beeminder was effective for me for consistently flossing. So I went back to using it to make sure I stick to my commitment. And my dentist doesn‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs a ‚Äúhabit‚Äù or something I do because an app triggers me, as long as I keep flossing.</p> <p>‚Äì</p> <div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"> <ol> <li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote"> <p>1: Other measures are possible too: How many steps?
